# How's it going?

* Anyone still not in a group? Remember that it's a requirement to be eligible for the exam.
* Did you manage to create an organization on GitHub?
* Did you manage to create a valid pull request to groups.py?

# How did the refactoring from Python 2 to 3 go?

* What did you have to change?

* Which files did you modify and how?

* Did you create a release with your refactored solution?

# How did the dependency graph task go?


There are tools that could help you with this task such as:

- [`pipdeptree`](https://pypi.org/project/pipdeptree/) for the pure Python dependencies.

# An example of a thorough dependency graph

# Why do we do that? Why do I have to understand other peoples' code?

> "**Unfortunately, computer programming education often focuses on how to single-handedly develop programs from scratch in a single language and single execution environment**, a development style prevalent in the 1950s and 60s. **Nowadays, software development is typically a team-based activity and most often involves extending and maintaining existing systems written in a multitude of languages for diverse execution environments**. It’s now even more important to understand code concepts, forms, structures, and idioms to be able to write code that other programmers can read easily."

[Diomidis Spinellis _"Reading, Writing, and Code: The key to writing readable code is developing good coding style."_](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/957717.957782)

# Work systematically

While working, take notes of what you are doing.

A text file in your workspace might serve you well as a notebook.

Keep a record of when you did what.

Note down what went wrong, where you found a solution, and keep a link for that.

**This is a course requirement that will not be given as a weekly assignment since it should be done from start until the end.**

**It is important for your leaning outcome, and it is important for your exam project!**
